# Fashion MNIST Image Recognition Project with TensorFlow

## Description
This project aims to apply and compare various neural network algorithms for images recognition on the Fashion MNIST dataset. It's a project to improve my skills with Tensorflow and Python. Utilizing TensorFlow, a machine learning and neural networks library, this project strives to accurately identify different types of fashion items in the Fashion MNIST dataset.


## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeBrgnFR/FashionMnist.git
```

Install the necessary dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `data` directory. 
Download the dataset at `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist` and unzip the file in the `data` directory.


## Project Structure
- `data`: Directory with the datasets.
- `fashion_mnist.ipynb`: Run all cells to execute the program with a simple Convolutional Neural Network.
- `fashion_mnist.ipynb`: Run all cells to execute the program with a tree Convolutional Neural Networks and two different vote systems.
- `results`: Old executed notebooks in HTML format.  


## Results
Describe the results obtained with your model here, including:
- Classification accuracy on the test set.
- A discussion on the model's performance.
- Visualizations of the model's predictions (optional).

## Conclusion
Summarize key learnings from this project, as well as possible future improvements.
